Your code should be readable and generally well-documented.
General aspects taken into consideration when grading:

- consistent indentation
- avoid duplicate code
- remove commented code
- avoid 'long' functions (more than ~100 lines) 
- avoid hardcoded values
- avoid long variable names
- avoid memory leaks
- compiler warnings
- avoid mixing whitespaces with tabs
- avoid long lines (> ~80 characters for C, > ~100 characters for Java)
- write your name at the start of every source file/in the Readme file

Remember, 10% of the assignment code is reserved for the quality of your coding 
style.
